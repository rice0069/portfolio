Repository for my portfolio website (Web Dev II final assignment)

# **Tell us about your process, challenges you faced during development and how you overcame those changes. What have you learned by creating your web portfolio?**

## The process

The process I used when developing this website was honestly quite disorganized. I didn't make any wireframes or think of the design before starting development. 

I knew I wanted everything on a single scroll website due to some advice my father (who was a manager for the government) gave me a while ago about how employers typically like receiving resumes that are short and simple. A piece of advice he gave me was that my resume should be on a single, double sided piece of paper. So I figured I would apply that advice to my portfolio website as well. 

I took SOME elements from my past wireframes from the UX/UI design class this semester, like how the website starts with the SVG logo I have at the top of the website. As well as a pseudo navigation with links to the accordion (Graphic Design, Web Development, Video Editing, UX/UI Design etc...) but the overall layout of the site was imporvised and created as I went along coding the site.

## The challenges

One of the challenges I faced when developping this website was that initially, I wasn't confident in my knowledge of Bootstrap, before I started development I thought I was going to really struggle with this project because of that. But what I ended up doing is I watched the zoom recordings of our classes that went over Bootstrap aswell as watched some video guides about it on Youtube. This really helped me get started.

Another challenge I faced was that I wasn't sure what dimensions I should make my images for the website. I don't really understand what sizes my images should be in order to be optimized. I ended making two versions of each image, one that was the default size and one that was smaller for when the site was being loaded on smaller sized viewports. I'm not really sure if the sizes I chose are good or not so if you're reading this and could give me some feedback/advice on the subject I would greatly appreciate it.
