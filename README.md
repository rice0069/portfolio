Repository for my portfolio website (Web Dev II final assignment)

# **Tell us about your process, challenges you faced during development and how you overcame those changes. What have you learned by creating your web portfolio?**

## The process

The process I used when developing this website was honestly quite disorganized. I didn't make any wireframes or think of the design before starting development. 

I knew I wanted everything on a single scroll website due to some advice my father (who was a manager for the government) gave me a while ago about how employers typically like receiving resumes that are short and simple. A piece of advice he gave me was that my resume should be on a single, double sided piece of paper. So I figured I would apply that advice to my portfolio website as well. 

I took SOME elements from my past wireframes from the UX/UI design class this semester, like how the website starts with the SVG logo I have at the top of the website. As well as a pseudo navigation with links to the accordion (Graphic Design, Web Development, Video Editing, UX/UI Design etc...) but the overall layout of the site was imporvised and created as I went along coding the site.

## The challenges

One of the biggest challenges I faced was actually starting to work on this website. I was hesitant to start development because I was anxious about using the Bootstrap framework. I didn't have a very good understanding of the framework and I initially felt more comfortable hardcoding the whole website, but I couldn't due to the requirements of the project. 

When I finally decided to start the project I started by rewatched the Zoom classroom recordings from when we started learning/using Bootstrap in class (I believe this was the week 9 & 10 recordings) as well as watched some video guides on Youtube. Working alongside these resources helped make me feel more confident in using Bootstrap to develop my website and once I truly got started, I found that Bootstrap made developing many parts of this site much, much easier.
